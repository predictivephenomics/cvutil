Description: Computer Vision UTILity Toolkit
 cvutil is a C++ computer vision library that extends the 
 functionality of OpenCV. The library contains some functions 
 that are frequently used computer vision developers for 
 convenience. The library uses multi-threading, vectorization 
 routines available in Intel's AVX 2.0 to execute algorithms 
 in the library. The optimizaion can be disabled optionally.
